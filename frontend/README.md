# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some Oxlint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and Oxlint's TypeScript related rules in your project.




## Stage 4: components rendered from data

The list of interventions is rendered dynamically using two React components:
- `InterventieCard` receives one intervention through props and displays its information.
- `InterventieList` receives the array of interventions and renders a card for each item using `map` and a unique `key`.
- An explicit message is displayed when the list is empty.

## Stage 5: local state and events
The list lives in React state. Checking and deleting work from the page,
and the counters in the header follow automatically. A button in the
header switches between light and dark mode.

## Status
- [x] Stage 3: Vite and React project
- [x] Stage 4: components rendered from data
- [x] Stage 5: local state and events
